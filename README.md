## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scholarship-disbursement-dapp.git
cd scholarship-disbursement-dapp

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
npm install

3️⃣ Compile Smart Contracts
npx hardhat compile

4️⃣ Deploy to a Network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>

5️⃣ Start the Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

🧪 Testing

To run unit tests for the smart contracts:

npx hardhat test


You can also use Hardhat’s local blockchain for testing deployments and transactions before deploying to a live network.

🔐 Security and Access Control

Access control ensures only authorized administrators can create or approve scholarships.

All transactions and fund movements are recorded immutably on the blockchain.

Funds are held securely within the smart contract until disbursement conditions are met.

Regular audits are recommended before mainnet deployment.

🧩 Future Enhancements

Integration with IPFS for decentralized document storage

Multi-chain compatibility (Polygon, BSC, etc.)

DAO-based governance for fund management

Notification system for applicants and admins

Advanced analytics dashboard for institutions
